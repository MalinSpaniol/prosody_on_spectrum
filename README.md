This is the code four the interactive shiny app which accompanies our review article "Linguistic Prosody in Autism Spectrum Disorder—An Overview" (Grice, Wehrle, Krüger, Spaniol, Cangemi & Vogeley, 2023) 
published in Language and Linguistics Compass. We plan to update all figures and tables as and when new papers on this topic are published. We therefore encourage researchers to inform us of any work that 
they believe should feature in the online version of this overview, which is intended be updated continuously.

If you know of any relevant literature, which is not on the list yet, please simply reach out to one of us or submit the new paper following our submission form:
