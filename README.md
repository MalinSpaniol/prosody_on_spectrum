# Prosody on the spectrum 

This is the code four our interactive shiny app: https://malin.shinyapps.io/shiny_ASD_Prosody_Review/ 

This app accompanies our review article "Linguistic Prosody in Autism Spectrum Disorder—An Overview" (Grice, Wehrle, Krüger, Spaniol, Cangemi & Vogeley, 2023) 
published in Language and Linguistics Compass [https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1749818x](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lnc3.12498).

Linguistic prosody, involving the rhythm and melody of speech, enhances or modifies the meaning of spoken words. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), research on prosody covers both production and perception of various linguistic functions, from grammatical features to pragmatic aspects like turn-taking. This review of 51 studies shows mixed results, with tentative evidence suggesting greater differences in the perception of intuitive functions. Variability in results stems from methodological differences and the wide age range studied, as difficulties in prosody for autistic children may not persist into adulthood, and compensatory strategies can be learned.

It is excellent to have the current research landscape covered by this review, but it would be even better to continuously update and maintain an overview as the landscape evolves. Therefore, we created this interactive website to make it easier to browse through the literature, find relevant information and sources, and, most importantly, add new references as they are published. We therefore encourage you to inform us of any work that you believe should feature in the online version of this overview, which is intended be updated continuously.

If you know of any relevant literature, which is not on the list yet, please simply reach out to one of us or submit the new paper following our submission form:
